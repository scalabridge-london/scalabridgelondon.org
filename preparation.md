This page describes how you should prepare for ScalaBridge: software to install and things to read.


## Software

To prepare for ScalaBridge you should attempt to install some software, as described below. This can be complicated process so don't worry if you can't get it work---we can help you on the day if needed.
Here is what we recommend:

* If you are joining an online session, which is what we are currently (March 2020) doing, you should install [Visual Studio Code][vscode] and the following extensions: Live Share Extension Pack, Scala (Metals), Scala Syntax (official), GitLens.

* For online sessions you will also want spend a bit of time on your AV setup. You definitely need speakers or headphones, and a microphone. We strongly encourage a video camera as well. This doesn't have to be expensive. A phone headset and a laptop camera are completely adequate, for example.


For in-person sessions we can be a bit freer in the software we use:

* if you already have something set up, or you are comfortable with a particular tool in another language, keep using that; otherwise

* use [Visual Studio Code][vscode] or [IntelliJ][intellij], depending on personal preference. IntelliJ has more features but might be more confusing, and you'll need a decent laptop to run it. If using IntelliJ use the [Scala bundle][intellij] installer to get everything needed for Scala development. If using Visual Studio Code install [Metals][metals] and the [Scala syntax][scala-syntax].


For either online or in-person sessions, once you have a development environment download (or fork or clone, if you are familiar with Git) the [Creative Scala template](https://github.com/creativescala/creative-scala-template) to get a simple Scala project (with some reasonably appealing output). You may need to install the [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8) as well, if your computer doesn't already have it installed.


## Reading
