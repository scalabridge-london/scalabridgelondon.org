This page describes how you should prepare for ScalaBridge: software to install and things to read.


## Software

To prepare for ScalaBridge you should attempt to install some software, as described below. This can be complicated process so don't worry if you can't get it work---we can help you on the day if needed.
Here is what we recommend:

* if you already have something set up, or you are comfortable with a particular tool in another language, keep using that; otherwise
* use [Visual Studio Code][vscode] or [IntelliJ][intellij], depending on personal preference. IntelliJ has more features but might be more confusing, and you'll need a decent laptop to run. If using IntelliJ use the [Scala bundle][intellij] installer to get everything needed for Scala development. If using Visual Studio Code install [Metals][metals] and the [Scala syntax][scala-syntax].

Once they have a development environment they can download or clone the [Creative Scala template](https://github.com/creativescala/creative-scala-template) to get a simple Scala project (with some reasonably appealing output). They may need to install the [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/8) as well, if their computer doesn't already have it installed.


## Reading

Take a look at the [curriculum][curriculum] and [teaching][teaching] pages to see what and how we teach, and the reading your should do before a session.
