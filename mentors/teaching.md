This page covers *how* we teach Scala at ScalaBridge; our pedadgogy. The [curriculum](/mentors/curriculum) page covers what we teach.


## Why Worry About Pedagogy

Teaching is a skill that can learned, and improving at this skill definitely makes a difference to how effective our lessons are. We all have experience of teaching to some extent, so our baseline level of skill is probably higher than the average person's baseline programming ability, but that doesn't mean the ceiling is low.

We want to improve the teaching at ScalaBridge London, so we have some specific teaching techniques we want you to use, along with some general tips. The techniques may not work, but at least if we are intentional in what we try we can make definite statements about our results and improve our techniques. So please try to use the techniques below.
