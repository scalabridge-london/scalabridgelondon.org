Mentors help the students learn Scala and represent the Scala community. Mentors need to have some Scala knowledge (but they don't need to be an expert) and a willingness to help. Being a mentor is a great way to improve at Scala, as teaching others forces you to solidify your own knowledge. If you're interested in joining ScalaBridge as a mentor please [sign up!](/joining).

On this page we answer some common questions about ScalaBridge, and link off to other pages that have more indepth discussions.


## Overview

Our main activity is small group teaching. This means learning Scala in a small group consisting of a few students of roughly the same level and a mentor. If possible we'll keep the groups together, but this won't always happen. You job as the mentor is guide the students, give them feedback, but don't do the work for them! More on how to teach is on the [pedagogy](/pedagogy) page.


## Software

Students need a development environment to use Scala, and you will probably need to help them use it. Here is what we recommend:

* if the student already has something set up, or they are comfortable in a particular tool in another language, keep using that; otherwise
* use [Visual Studio Code][vscode] or [IntelliJ][intellij], depending on which you feel best able to support. Note that low spec laptops struggle with IntelliJ; VS Code is a better option here. Make sure you install the [Scala bundle][intellij]. If using Visual Studio Code install [Metals][metals] and the [Scala syntax][scala-syntax].


## Curriculum

What the students will be learning depends on their current level of knowledge. This is discussed on the [curriculum](/curriculum) page.


## Attendance

It isn't necessary for mentors to attend every session. Life (and even holidays) happen. It's fine.
