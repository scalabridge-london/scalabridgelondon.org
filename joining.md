So you want to join ScalaBridge? That's great! Here's what you should do to make sure you hear about everything that's going on:

* Join the [ScalaBridge meetup group][meetup], which is where we announce upcoming events.
* Join the [ScalaBridge slack][slack], and the `#london` channel in that Slack, which is where we chat. (If this link has expired please email {% email %} and we'll create a new one.)
* Fill out [this form][student-form] if you're a student, or [this form][mentor-form] if you're a mentor, so we know a bit about your background and can plan accordingly.
* Now read the [preparation][preparation] page for next steps.


Things to be aware of:

* ScalaBridge's goal is to increase diversity within the Scala community. We're looking for students from groups, however defined, that are underrepresented within the community.
* All ScalaBridge events are covered by our [code of conduct][coc].
