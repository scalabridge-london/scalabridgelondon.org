At ScalaBridge we divide our year into on seasons and off seasons. It's a bit like school terms and holidays, but we still plan to hold meetings during the off season, just at a reduced frequency.


## On-Season

The on season is an intensive period where we work hard and learn a lot. Currently our on season is 6 weeks long, and we hold weekly meetings during the on season. We plan to have two or three on seasons in a year.


## Off-Season

During the off season we reduce the frequency of meetings so we can catch up the rest of our lives. Our meetings are also more informal, giving more time and space for socialising and following our own interests.
